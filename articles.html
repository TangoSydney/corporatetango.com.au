  <b>What is Tango?</b><br />
  <br />
  Argentine Tango is often close embrace, involves a definite lead and follow, constantly caresses the floor and is danced to music similar to classical music - combined with the unmistakeable and unique sound of a squeezebox called a "bandoneon".<br />
  <br />
  The unique component of tango is the sweet melancholy of its melody combined with the liveliness of its beats, partly reflecting its history. The biggest myth about tango is that it is difficult to learn. The steps aren't complicated! Its essence is popular - from the streets. It is learned by practice.<br />
  <br />
  The basic steps are like lego pieces - the man decides what order to put them in. So you could have 10 couples in the same room, dancing to the same music at the same time, and doing totally different combinations of steps.<br />
  <br />
  If you like the music, you're halfway there. You can start with music that has a regular rhythm pattern and gradually move to more complex and variable music, allowing your untapped intuitive and creative aspects to emerge.

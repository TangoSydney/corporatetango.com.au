<h4>Team Building</h4>

<p>
  If people are an organisation's greatest asset - or at least have the power to "make or break" the organisation, affect its productivity and impact the bottom line - then getting the best out of these people must be a priority.
</p>

<p>
  Power only exists if there is a relationship. The most effective power is that of an aligned group of people with a common purpose.

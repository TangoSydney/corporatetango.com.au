  Corporate Tango develops communication, leadership, teamwork, connection, commitment, confidence, creativity, and group alignment within a unique, innovative and fun dance environment.

<p>
  The way people dance Argentine Tango is a microcosm of how they are in life. Tango is a journey, not a destination. By increasing people's abilities on the dance floor, they are empowered to overcome self-limiting beliefs and perform better in life, at both professional and personal levels.

  No matter how successful and confident a person appears to be at work, the tango floor is a level playing field!

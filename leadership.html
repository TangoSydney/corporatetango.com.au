<h4>Leadership Program</h4>

<p>
  In a corporate situation, employees may have little choice but to follow. But are the results the best they can be?
</p>

<p>
  On the tango dance floor, the leader invites someone to dance (follow), but the follower chooses whether or not to accept. Hence, the ultimate power lies with the follower.
</p>

<p>
  Good leaders attract many followers.
</p>

<p>
  The difference between a good leader and a great leader is the emotional input and therefore how the follower feels during, and as a result of, the interaction.
</p>

<p>
  Tango's journey involves taking a risk, venturing into the unknown, stepping firmly but not knowing what will come next. It is like learning "the wisdom of uncertainty" <span class="small">(Chopra)</span>; a way of dealing with reality where you are ready to forsee what is coming based on a deep perception of the here and now rather than anticipating reality based on already fixed paradigms or patterns.
</p>

<p>
  The business world is evolving in ways that cannot be anticipated with orthodox paradigms. Argentine Tango can help provide insights into new ways of coping with changing paradigms.' <span class="small">(S.Grant &amp; G.Ramazzotti)</span>
